# Introduction
Baguio City faces critical challenges in emergency response and disaster preparedness. A recent resolution revealed that many residents remain unaware of emergency hotline numbers, and these numbers are often inaccessible or inconsistently disseminated across platforms. This lack of awareness directly impacts the efficiency of emergency response times, which are crucial in a disaster-prone area like Baguio. The city is identified as one of Asia's seven most risk-prone cities, with a staggering 90% of its barangays classified as high-risk for various disasters. Its topography makes it vulnerable to typhoons, floods, and landslides, increasing the need for well-coordinated emergency management. Despite efforts by the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO), gaps in public knowledge and preparedness persist.
# Objective
